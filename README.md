# CarCollection
This project is a Kotlin-based console application that allows users to manage a collection of car records using object-oriented programming techniques. Users can:

Add a new car with make, model, year, and odometer

Display all stored cars

Sort cars by make

Search for a car by make

Save the car list to a binary file (cars.dat)

Load the list back from the file

The program includes exception handling to prevent crashes from invalid input or file errors. It uses Kotlin's ArrayList and Serializable interfaces to manage data and persist it between sessions.
